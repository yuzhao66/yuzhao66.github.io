Welcome to my website ðŸŒ¸ My name is Yu Zhao (Chinese as èµµé›¨), and you can call me Zoey. I am currently working as a Research Assistant under the guidance of <a href="https://xiaoyangye.github.io/">Dr. Xiaoyang Ye</a>, Visiting Professor at East China Normal University, and <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/huihuaxie#973816">Prof. Huihua Xie</a> from Zhejiang University. During 2020 - 2023, I was a Master student in Rural Development Economics and Management at Renmin University of China, with a focus on rural education. Throughout this period, I engaged in research collaborations with <a href="https://jianguowang.weebly.com/">Prof. JianGuo Wang</a> and <a href="http://slhr.ruc.edu.cn/szdw/zzjs/ldgx/zgs/226d274fc66240e0b01b3c01243ef853.htm">Prof. GuangSu Zhou</a>. Furthermore, I undertook a research internship program led by <a href="https://www.utu.fi/en/people/satu-helske">Prof. Satu Helske</a> during my exchange at the University of Turku in Finland.
