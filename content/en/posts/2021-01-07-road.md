I am a participant in an online study group organized by Professor Ge Yuhao from Renmin University of China, focusing on "Machine Learning and Deep Learning." The objective of this group is to comprehend the principles of machine learning and deep learning, enabling participants to independently write Python code to implement common algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, and more.

Attached are my study notes, with updates every two days. The learning journey is ongoing, and further content will be added soon.
